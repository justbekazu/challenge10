# Roster Generator

This is a roster generator based in Node JS. This application was built using the OOP method and TDD... kinda.

## Instructions

* When the app is starter, the user will prompted to put in information about each employee.

* After the user fills in the profile information, they will be asked to enter another profile or to quit.

 * If a user selects the profile to be an "intern" then additional prompts will be presented. 

* Once the information has been put in, the app will create a HTML file.
  
*  From this file, the user will be able to launch to the web.

* From this website, the user will be able to click on various links to access the profile"s email address and github account.
